I'm a Brazilian/Portuguese Chemical Engineer from the Federal University of Rio de
Janeiro (UFRJ), having done a double degree exchange at ESPCI - Paris. I've
become interested in programming with Python and Deep Learning for engineering
applications by the beginning of 2021. Since then, I've worked on the subject on
a few different projects. To know more, check out my [GitHub.io page](https://antoniorochaaz.github.io/)!
