I'm a Double Degree Engineering Student at the Federal University of Rio de
Janeiro (UFRJ) and ESPCI - Paris. I've become interested in programming with
Python and Deep Learning for engineering applications by the beginning of 2021.
Since then, I've worked on the subject on three different projects:

1. A project for the *Introduction to Deep Learining* class, developing a CNN
   for microfluidic drop recognition and classification.
2. An internship on Battery Health estimation, using concepts of [Transfer Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_learning#:~:text=Transfer%20learning%20(TL)%20is%20a,when%20trying%20to%20recognize%20trucks.)
   for applying models trained for one type of battery to different batteries.
3. My undergraduate thesis on Gas Emission prediction, developing and comparing
   prediction accuracies for different types of networks (NNs, CNNs, RNNs).
